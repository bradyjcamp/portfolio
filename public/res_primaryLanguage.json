Before pursuing software development I was a branch manager of a rental car company in Seattle. I decided to enter into software development because I have a strong desire to create web applications and solve dynamic problems utilizing programming. My ideal environment to showcase my programming and debugging skills would include working individually or in a team based setting. I have 4 years of previous experience in managing a team and being faced with problems and tasks to ensure customers receive quality products.",
